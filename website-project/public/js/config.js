// IMPORTANT: Configure this for your environment.
// This constant defines the base path for the application. It is used to ensure
// that all assets (like the navbar and footer) are loaded correctly, no matter
// where the page is located.

// --- INSTRUCTIONS ---
// 1. Identify the URL to your project's `public` directory.
// 2. The BASE_URL should be the path part of that URL.
//
// --- EXAMPLES ---
// A) If your site is at the root of a domain (e.g., http://my-awesome-site.com/):
//    export const BASE_URL = '/';
//
// B) If your site is in a subdirectory (e.g., http://localhost/househunting/website-project/public/):
//    export const BASE_URL = '/househunting/website-project/public/';
//
// C) If you are using a local server and the project is at the root of the htdocs/www folder:
//    (e.g., http://localhost/)
//    export const BASE_URL = '/';

// PLEASE SET THE CORRECT VALUE FOR YOUR SETUP:
// Use an empty string so paths are relative to the current page. This works
// when pages are served from a subdirectory (e.g. /househunting/website-project/public/).
export const BASE_URL = '/househunting/website-project/public/';
