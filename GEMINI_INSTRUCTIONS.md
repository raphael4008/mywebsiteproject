# Gemini Instructions

Hello again! We're one step closer. The previous output confirms the script is running but not reading the `.env` file. I've added another line of code to check if the `.env` file is even being found.

Please run the setup script one more time and **send me the new output**.

### Run this command from the `website-project` directory:

```bash
php database/setup_db.php
```

This output will tell us if the problem is the file's location or something else. Thanks for your continued help!
